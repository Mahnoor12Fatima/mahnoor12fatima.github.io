      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly one of the great minds of our time, Christopher Hitchens challenged his readers to think deeply on topics of politics, religion, war, and science. This Jekyll theme is designed in his memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Christopher_Hitchens_2008-04-24_001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Christopher Hitchens&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Fri Tanke and licensed under the &lt;a href=&#34;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en&#34;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported&lt;/a&gt; license.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Eric Hitchens (13 April 1949 – 15 December 2011) was an Anglo-American author, columnist, essayist, orator, religious and literary critic, social critic, and journalist. Hitchens was the author, co-author, editor or co-editor of over 30 books, including five collections of essays on culture, politics, and literature. A staple of public discourse, his confrontational style of debate made him both a lauded intellectual and a controversial public figure. He contributed to &lt;em&gt;New Statesman, The Nation, The Weekly Standard, The Atlantic, London Review of Books, The Times Literary Supplement, Slate, Free Inquiry&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &amp;lsquo;Content here, content here&amp;rsquo;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &amp;rsquo;lorem ipsum&amp;rsquo; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &amp;ldquo;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&amp;rdquo; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &amp;ldquo;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&amp;rdquo;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
